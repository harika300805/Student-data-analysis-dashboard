# Student-data-analysis-dashboard

This project showcases an interactive Student Data Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard visualizes and analyzes various academic and demographic data of students, providing insights into performance trends, attendance, and other critical metrics.

## Key Features

- **Student Performance Analysis:** Visualizations of student grades across different subjects,or courses to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
- **Attendance Tracking:** A visual representation of student attendance to highlight trends and correlate them with academic performance.
- **Demographic Insights:** Breakdown of student data based on demographics like age, gender, etc., for a comprehensive understanding of the student population.
- **Data Filtering and Drill-Downs:** Users can interact with the dashboard by filtering data based on specific criteria (e.g., subject, gender, average) and drilling down into detailed views for deeper analysis.
- **Trend Analysis:** Track academic progress and changes over time, helping to predict future performance or identify potential issues early.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Multiple charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, line graphs) to present data in an intuitive and user-friendly way.
- **Dynamic Reporting:** Allows for easy export and sharing of insights, making it convenient for educators or administrators to make data-driven decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** For data visualization, dashboard creation, and report generation.
- **Power Query:** To clean, transform, and load data from various sources (e.g., CSV files, Excel sheets).
- **Data Sources:** The dashboard can integrate data from various educational systems, spreadsheets, or APIs.
